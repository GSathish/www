== The Illusion of Parallelism

image::concurrency/concurrency-2.svg[width="100%"]

[.lead]
//
All processors create the _illusion_ of parallelism by rapidly switching between
multiple programs.

== Human Perceptual Limitations

[.lead]
//
Why does this work? [.s]#Because _you are slow_.#

Assuming a 1 GHz processor:

[.s]
//
* 15 ms "rule of thumb": [.s]#*15,000,000* clock cycles!#
//
* 40 ms based on 25 frames-per-second for "smooth" video: [.s]#*40,000,000*
clock cycles!#
//
* 100 ms was the rule for old telephone systems, the delay point after
which human conversation patterns start to break down: [.s]#*100,000,000*
clock cycles!#

== Today's Reality: Both Real and Illusory Parallelism

[.lead]
//
Today even your phone has multiple cores. So we have both:

[.s]
//
* *Real* parallelism: your phone is _actually_ doing multiple things at once
//
* *Illusory* parallelism: each core is still rapidly switching between programs
to create the illusion of _more_ parallelism.

So far all of the code we've written this semester only does _one thing_ at a
time.

Sometimes we call this _single-threaded_, for reasons that will make sense
shortly.

== Final Project Video

[.lead]
//
Before you attend this week's lab you need to upload your *final project video*
to YouTube and submit the link using this form.

* We'll be showing these videos in class...
//
* ...and at Thursday's Final Project Fair.
//
* Format is up to you, but you should definitely demo and discuss your final
project.
//
Both partners should be involved somehow.

== Final Project Fair

[.lead]
//
A reminder that our inaugural CS 125 Final Project Fair is _this Thursday_
(5/3/2018) from 4&ndash;6PM in Siebel.
//
1% extra credit for participating.

[.s]
//
* Each lab section will choose two most impressive projects: one from a group of
beginners, and a second in an open category.
//
* Judging is from 4&ndash;5:15PM, meaning that you should be set up and ready to
go at 4PM.
//
* There will be (good) food.
//
* There will be awards at *5:30PM* in _Siebel 1404_.

[[oPmlAhLQXZHOyRTDLtxayLbzuEYIKtQF]]
== Announcements

* Tonight will be the _last_ Even More Practice (EMP) section.

* link:/MP/7/[MP7 (the final project)] is out.
//
Please get started!
//
* The
//
https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/info/feedback/[anonymous feedback form]
//
remains available on the course website. Use it to give us feedback!
//
* My office hours continue today at 11AM in the lounge outside of Siebel 0226.
