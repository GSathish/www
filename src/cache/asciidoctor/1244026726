<p>Welcome to Android!
For MP6 you&#8217;ll get introduced to Android by modifying a simple app.
But the core topic of the MP are actually using application programmer
interfaces (APIs) and serialization.
You&#8217;ll get practice using the
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a>
and on parsing data formatted in
<a href="https://www.json.org/">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a>,
a simple and widely-supported data exchange format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>MP6 is due Wednesday 4/11/2018 @ 5PM.
To receive full credit, you must submit by this deadline.</strong>
In addition, 10% of your grade on MP6 is for submitting code that earns at least
<em>40 points</em> by <strong>Monday 4/9/2018 @ 5PM.</strong>
As usual, late submissions will be subject to the
<a href="/info/syllabus/#regrading">MP late submission policy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">1. Learning Objectives</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MP6 introduces you to using integrating external APIs into your projects and to
Android development.
We&#8217;ll show you how to use the powerful <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a> to analyze image data, and you&#8217;ll
learn how to process the results.
We&#8217;ll also introduce you to the structure of a simple Android app, and you&#8217;ll
get practice modifying the UI to reflect the information provided by the
Cognitive Services API.
We&#8217;ll also continue to reinforce the learning objectives from previous MPs
(<a href="/MP/0/">0</a>, <a href="/MP/1/">1</a>, <a href="/MP/2/">2</a>, <a href="/MP/3/">3</a>,
<a href="/MP/4/">4</a>, and <a href="/MP/5/">5</a>).</p>

<h2 id="structure">2. Assignment Structure</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike previous MPs, MP6 is split into two pieces:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>/lib/</code>: a small library that extracts certain pieces of information from the
image data returned by the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a>.
<strong>This library is the only part of the MP tested by the test suite.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/app/</code>: an Android app for you to use for your own interactive testing.
The Android app is <em>almost</em> complete, but needs a few modifications from you.
And, to work correctly, you need to finish the library in <code>lib</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="lib">2.1. MP6 Image Recognition Library (<code>lib</code>)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="#app">MP6 app</a> handles uploading photos to the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a>.
However, once the results are returned it relies on your library to extract a
few pieces of "important" information:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The image width, height, and format</strong>: using <code>getWidth</code>, <code>getHeight</code>, and
<code>getFormat</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The autogenerated image caption</strong>: using <code>getCaption</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whether the image contains a dog or a cat</strong> <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>: using
<code>isADog</code> and <code>isACat</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whether you&#8217;ve been
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling">rickrolled</a></strong>:
that is, whether the photo contains
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Astley">Rick Astley</a>,
using <code>isRick</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As always, you may find our
<a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP6-Starter/">official MP6 online documentation</a>
useful as you understand what you need to do.
If you believe that the documentation is unclear, please post on the <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/c/mps/mp6" class="noexternal">forum</a> and
we&#8217;ll offer clarification as needed.
To complete this part of the assignment you&#8217;ll want to review the
<a href="#json">section on JSON below</a>.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="app">2.2. MP6 App</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The MP6 app handles obtaining images&mdash;either ones save previously on the
device, captured by the camera, or downloaded from the internet.
It also uploads those images to the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a> and updates the UI
appropriately&mdash;or at least parts of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To complete MP6 most of the lines of code that you write will be completing the
<a href="#lib">image recognition library</a>.
However, there are a few small changes that we encourage you to make so that the
user interface functions properly.
We&#8217;ve done a few things to get you started.
Examine <code>finishProcessImage</code> to see how we use the results from <code>getWidth</code>,
<code>getHeight</code>, and <code>getFormat</code> to update a part of the UI.
To complete the UI you&#8217;ll need to do the following things:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Update the caption</strong> using the result from <code>getCaption</code>.
You should be able to use our example of updating the description as a starting
point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Show or hide the cat and dog icons as appropriate.</strong>
You may want to look at <code>updateCurrentBitmap</code> for examples of how these icons
are <em>hidden</em> when the current image is cleared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do something when you find Rick.</strong>
You do want to celebrate, right?
Maybe try something
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/574195/android-youtube-app-play-video-intent">like
this</a>.</p>

<h3 id="getting">2.3. Obtaining MP6</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note that we are using Android Studio for MP6.</strong>
Use
<a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/qJ5dPKlE">this GitHub Classroom invitation link</a>
to fork your copy of MP6.
Once your repository has been created, import it into <strong>Android Studio</strong> following

<h3 id="requirements">2.4. Your Goal</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point you should be familiar with the requirements from previous MPs.
See the <a href="#grading">grading description below</a>.
However, note that for MP6 <strong>we have not provided a complete test suite</strong>.
You will have to figure out how to test your Rick Astley detection yourself.</p>

<h2 id="approach">3. Approaching MP6</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>As you approach MP6, focus on two core tasks: <a href="#json">working with JSON</a>, and
starting to find your way around <a href="#android">Android</a>.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="json">3.1. JSON</h3>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="android">3.2. Android</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Android is a Java-based framework for building smartphone apps that run on the
Android platform.
By learning how to build Android apps, your programs can have enormous impact.
As of a year ago, Google estimated that there were
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/17/2-billion-active-android-devices/"><em>2
billion</em></a>
active Android devices.
That&#8217;s over 25% of people on Earth&mdash;and
<a href="http://fortune.com/2017/03/06/apple-iphone-use-worldwide/">several times more
than iOS</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, Android is also a huge and complex system.
It&#8217;s easy to feel lost when you are getting started.
Our best advice is to just slow down, take a deep breath, and try to understand
a bit of what is going on at a time.
We&#8217;ll try to walk you through a few of the salient bits for MP6 below.</p>
