<p>Let&#8217;s get started!
The goal of our first lab is to prepare you to begin work on <a href="/MP/0/">MP0</a>.
You&#8217;ll prepare your development environment by installing
<a href="/MP/setup/java/">Java</a> and <a href="/MP/setup/intellij">IntelliJ</a>, and walk
through the process of committing and submitting your work using
<a href="/MP/setup/git">Git</a>.</p>

<p>But first let&#8217;s spend a few minutes getting to know each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure that you introduce yourself to your
<a href="/info/people/#tas">teaching assistant</a>,
and to the <a href="/info/people/#cas">volunteer course assistants</a>
that are helping with your section.
This is also a great opportunity to meet other students!
At some point during this lab section, try to find:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>a person from your dorm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a person from the same major</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a person with programming experience&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#8230;&#8203;and one without programming experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>somebody very different from you</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make it a goal today to learn <em>and remember</em> the names of five other students.
The course staff will be working hard this semester to learn your
names&mdash;but please be patient with us.</p>

<h3 id="_working_together">1.1. Working Together</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll frequently be working together in groups in our lab sections&#8230;&#8203; and for
the rest of your life as a technologist.
So it&#8217;s something worth getting good at.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When working with a new group of people, it&#8217;s best to try to get out of your
comfort zone a bit&mdash;especially at first.
If you&#8217;re used to doing a lot of talking, try to listen and make room for
other voices.
And if you&#8217;re a bit on the quiet side, try to speak up and actively
participate.
Things get easier once everyone gets comfortable with each other.</p>

you need to enable Google integration for your @illinois.edu

Follow

<p>There are three setup tutorials to complete;</p>

<li>
<p><a href="/MP/setup/java/">Install Java</a></p>

<p>Once you complete the tutorials above, continue with the rest of the lab

<p>Now let&#8217;s walk through the process of obtaining, developing, and submitting
<a href="/MP/0">MP0</a>.
It&#8217;s due in less than two weeks, so we want you to get comfortable with this
process right away.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To complete this part of lab, read through and follow the
<a href="/MP/0/">MP0 instructions</a>.
<strong>Don&#8217;t leave your lab section until you have successfully submitted
MP0&mdash;even if your submission doesn&#8217;t earn any points yet.</strong>
If you finish early, find someone who hasn&#8217;t finished and help them out.
Future labs will have points for collective achievement, so this is a
good chance to practice working together with your entire section.</p>
