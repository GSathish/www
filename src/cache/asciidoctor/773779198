<p>Welcome to Android!
For MP6 you&#8217;ll get introduced to Android by modifying a simple app.
But the core topic of the MP are actually using application programmer
interfaces (APIs) and serialization.
You&#8217;ll get practice using the
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a>
and on parsing data formatted in
<a href="https://www.json.org/">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a>,
a simple and widely-supported data exchange format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>MP6 is due Friday 4/13/2018 @ 5PM.
To receive full credit, you must submit by this deadline.</strong>
In addition, 10% of your grade on MP6 is for submitting code that earns at least
<em>40 points</em> by <strong>Wednesday 4/11/2018 @ 5PM.</strong>
As usual, late submissions will be subject to the
<a href="/info/syllabus/#regrading">MP late submission policy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">1. Learning Objectives</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MP6 introduces you to using integrating external APIs into your projects and to
Android development.
We&#8217;ll show you how to use the powerful <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a> to analyze image data, and you&#8217;ll
learn how to process the results.
We&#8217;ll also introduce you to the structure of a simple Android app, and you&#8217;ll
get practice modifying the UI to reflect the information provided by the
Cognitive Services API.
We&#8217;ll also continue to reinforce the learning objectives from previous MPs

<p>Unlike previous MPs, MP6 is split into two pieces:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>/lib/</code>: a small library that extracts certain pieces of information from the
image data returned by the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a>.
<strong>This library is the only part of the MP tested by the test suite.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/app/</code>: an Android app for you to use for your own interactive testing.
The Android app is <em>almost</em> complete, but needs a few modifications from you.
And, to work correctly, you need to finish the library in <code>lib</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="#app">MP6 app</a> handles uploading photos to the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a>.
However, once the results are returned it relies on your library to extract a
few pieces of "important" information:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The image width, height, and format</strong>: using <code>getWidth</code>, <code>getHeight</code>, and

<h3 id="app">2.2. MP6 App</h3>

<p>The MP6 app handles obtaining images&mdash;either ones save previously on the
device, captured by the camera, or downloaded from the internet.
It also uploads those images to the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a> and updates the UI
appropriately&mdash;or at least parts of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To complete MP6 most of the lines of code that you write will be completing the
<a href="#lib">image recognition library</a>.
However, there are a few small changes that we encourage you to make so that the
user interface functions properly.
We&#8217;ve done a few things to get you started.
Examine <code>finishProcessImage</code> to see how we use the results from <code>getWidth</code>,
<code>getHeight</code>, and <code>getFormat</code> to update a part of the UI.
To complete the UI you&#8217;ll need to do the following things:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Update the caption</strong> using the result from <code>getCaption</code>.
You should be able to use our example of updating the description as a starting
point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Show or hide the cat and dog icons as appropriate.</strong>
You may want to look at <code>updateCurrentBitmap</code> for examples of how these icons
are <em>hidden</em> when the current image is cleared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do something when you find Rick.</strong>
You do want to celebrate, right?
Maybe try something

<h2 id="json">3. JSON</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>Object-oriented languages make it easy to model data internally by designing
classes.
But at times we need to exchange data between two different programs or systems,
possibly implemented in different languages.
That requires representing the data in a format that <em>both</em> systems can
understand.
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is one popular <em>data exchange</em> format in wide
use on the internet, and frequently used to communicate with web APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JSON is both simple and incredibly powerful.
It is based on only two different principles, but can represent a wide variety
of different data.
Using the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a> requires understanding JSON, and completing MP6 requires that
you implement several simple JSON parsing tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_json">3.1. What is JSON?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine we have an instance of the following Java class:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">public Person {
    public String name;
    public int age;

    Person(String setName, String setAge) {
        name = setName;
        age = setAge;
    }
}
Person geoffrey = new Person("Geoffrey", 38);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now image we want to send this information to another computer program: for
example, from an Android app written in Java to a web application programmer
interface (API) that could be written in Java, Python, or any other language.
How do we represent this information in a way that is correct and complete, yet
also portable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has become a popular answer to that question.
While it is named after
<a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a>,
the language that introduced JSON, JSON is now supported by pretty much every
common programming language.
This allows an app written in Java to communicate with a web API written in
Python, or a web application written in JavaScript to communicate with a web
backend written in Rust.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enough talk.
Here&#8217;s how the object above could be represented in JSON:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
  "name": "Geoffrey",
  "age": 38
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JSON has only <em>two</em> ways to structure data: objects and arrays.
Above you seen an example object.
Like Java, it has named variable (<code>name</code>, <code>age</code>) each of which takes on a
particular value ("Geoffrey", 38).
Here&#8217;s another example.
The following instance of this Java object:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock small">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">public Course {
    public String name;

    Course(String setName, String setEnrollment, double setAverageGrade) {
        name = setName;
        enrollment = setEnrollment;
        averageGrade = setAverageGrade;
    }
}
Course cs125 = new Course("CS 125", 500, 3.9);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>would be represented as this JSON string:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
  "name": "CS 125",
  "enrollment": 500,
  "averageGrade": 3.9
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JSON can also represent arrays.
This Java array:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">int[] array = new int[] { 1, 2, 10, 8 };</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>would be represented using this JSON string:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">[1, 2, 10, 8]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can also represent nested objects and objects with array instance variables:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">public Person {
    public String name;

    }
}
public Course {

    public int enrollment;
    public double averageGrade;
    public Person instructor;
    public int[] grades;

    Course(String setName, String setEnrollment,
        double setAverageGrade, Person setInstructor,
        int[] setGrades) {
        name = setName;
        enrollment = setEnrollment;

<h3 id="_parsing_json">3.2. Parsing JSON</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because JSON is supported by many different programming languages, many web APIs
return data in JSON format.
The <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a> is one of them.
To utilize this data, you must first <em>parse</em> it or <em>deserialize</em> it.
The process of converting a Java object&mdash;or object in any language&mdash;to
JSON is called serialization.
The reverse process is called deserialization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Happily, good libraries exist to parse JSON in every programming language.
Java is no exception.
We have included the Google
<a href="https://github.com/google/gson">GSON</a>
JSON parsing library in your project for you to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way to use GSON is to create a class that matches your JSON string.
So if you were provided with this JSON from a web API:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
  "number": 0,
  "caption": "I'm a zero"
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>you would design this Java class to represent it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">public class Result {
    public int number;
    public String caption;
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note how our classes mirrors both the names (<code>number</code>, <code>caption</code>) and types (<code>int</code>,
<code>String</code>) from the JSON result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, when you are working with unfamiliar JSON data, as you are in MP6, we
suggest that you <em>not</em> create new classes and instead
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16595493/gson-parsing-without-a-lot-of-classes">use
the built-in Java classes</a>.
Here&#8217;s an example of how to do this given the JSON string shown above:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">JsonParser parser = new JsonParser();
JsonObject result = parser.parse(jsonString).getAsJsonObject();
int number = result.get("number").getAsInt();
String caption = result.get("caption").getAsString();</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note that for MP6 we will not grade any addition class files you add to your
<code>lib</code> directory.</strong>

<p>Android is a Java-based framework for building smartphone apps that run on the
Android platform.
By learning how to build Android apps, your programs can have enormous impact.
As of a year ago, Google estimated that there were
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/17/2-billion-active-android-devices/"><em>2
billion</em></a>
active Android devices.
That&#8217;s over 25% of people on Earth&mdash;and
<a href="http://fortune.com/2017/03/06/apple-iphone-use-worldwide/">several times more
than iOS</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, Android is also a huge and complex system.
It&#8217;s easy to feel lost when you are getting started.
Our best advice is to just slow down, take a deep breath, and try to understand
a bit of what is going on at a time.
We&#8217;ll try to walk you through a few of the salient bits for MP6 below.</p>

<p>Like any other computer program, an important part of developing on Android is
generating debugging output.
On Android, our familiar <code>System.out.println</code>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2220547/why-doesnt-system-out-println-work-in-android">doesn&#8217;t quite work the same way we&#8217;re used to</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, Android has a simple yet powerful <em>logging</em> system.
Unlike <code>System.out.println</code>, logging systems allow you to specify multiple log
<em>levels</em> indicating the kind of output that you are generating.
This allows you to distinguish between, for example, debugging output that might
only be useful during development and a warning message that might indicate a
more serious problem or failure.
The Android logger also allows you to attach a <code>String</code> <em>tag</em> to each message to
help separate them when you are debugging or developing.
So the final syntax of the call to generate a debugging message, for example, is
<code>Log.d(TAG, message)</code>.</p>

<p>The Android
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html"><code>Activity</code> class</a>
corresponds to a single screen that the user can interact with.
Our simple app contains only one activity, but most apps consist of several:
maybe an activity corresponding to the app&#8217;s main screen, another for a
settings dialog, and still others for other parts of the app.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you might expect, there are two important moments for an activity: when it
appears on the screen, and when it leaves the screen.
Android provides functions that you can override to handle both of these events:
<code>onCreate</code> and <code>onPause</code>.
It is typical for on <code>onCreate</code> method to perform tasks required to make the
activity ready for a user to use, such as configuring buttons and other UI
elements.</p>

take the photo, rather than implementing a camera itself.
If you app wants to open a file, as another example, it can ask the file browser
to open the file, rather than implementing a file chooser itself.
This both greatly simplifies app development <em>and</em> provides users with a
familiar interface for the same actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our MP6 app uses intents to launch the camera and a file browser.
You do not need to understand this feature, but feel free to watch the
screencast above to learn more.
And you find it a fun way to respond to the unexpected appearance of Risk
Astley.</p>

<p>One of the core goals of every application, including smartphone apps, is to
maintain a responsive user interface.
If your app freezes for long periods of time, or even short ones, users will
quickly stop using it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Android accomplishes this by delegating certain slow operations to so-called
<em>background tasks</em>.
They then run independently of the user interface.
So your app can be simultaneously responding to new user input <em>and</em>, for
example, downloading a large file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an advanced topic and not one that we expect you to master on this MP or
even on future ones.
But if you want to learn a bit more, watch the screencast above.
Our MP6 app uses two background tasks: one to download files and save them to
local storage, the second to make requests to the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a>.</p>

<p>What is an API (application programmer interface)?
Put it this way&mdash;there are computer systems out there that can do <em>really</em>
cool things for you.
APIs provide a way to request their help, and easily integrate powerful features
into your applications.
You just have to learn how to use them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In MP6 we&#8217;re using the really cool <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a> to process images.
The screencast above will show you how to do that.
It also walks through the steps you need to add <em>your</em> <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a> key to your
project so that you can make your own requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, like any artificial intelligence system, the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a> is not perfect.
We&#8217;ve seen it produce some very amusing results.
If you find a good one, post it on the <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/c/mps/mp6" class="noexternal">forum</a> for us to giggle at.

<p><strong>Do you need to know this to complete MP6?</strong>
You don&#8217;t need to understand how the API call is made, but you <em>may</em> need to make
a few small changes to <code>Tasks.java</code> and understand the <a href="#csapi-json">JSON
returned</a> by the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services API</a>.
And you do need to add your API key so that your API calls work properly.</p>
