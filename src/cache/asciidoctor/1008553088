<p>Sorting and searching are fundamental computer science tasks.
They get to the heart of two things that computers are very good at: organizing
and retrieving data.
They are also building blocks on which other algorithms are built.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today&#8217;s lab introduces you to basic searching and sorting algorithms.
The written portion starts to develop your intuition about how sorting and
searching algorithms work, and how their performance might vary.
The programming component provides an opportunity to implement a few sorting
algorithms, and get a visceral sense of algorithm runtime.</p>

<p>As usual, we begin with a written lab component.
Please complete these exercises carefully.
Your course staff will review and discuss your answers along with the rest of
your section.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Complete this part of the lab in pairs using Google Docs.
Create a copy of <a href="https://goo.gl/FkeJMK">our document template</a>, and then edit it
to record you and your partner&#8217;s answers.
<strong>Note that you must open this document using your @illinois.edu Google Apps
account.</strong>
We will not grant access to non-Illinois users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Have a course staff member check your answers as you go.
When you are done, move on to the programming component.</p>

<p>Computers have gotten extremely fast, and as a result it can be easy to not care
about algorithm runtime when working on small problems.
But once data gets a bit bigger&mdash;and the world is full of big
data&mdash;the difference between algorithms starts to matter.
A lot.</p>

<p>The second part of the lab provides you with an opportunity to get up close and
personal with the implementation and performance of several classic sorting
algorithms.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve set up an
<a href="https://github.com/cs125-illinois/Lab10">Lab 10 GitHub repository</a>
containing an IntelliJ Project that&#8217;s correctly configured for Lab 10.
Getting access to it is similar to how you
<a href="/MP/setup/git/#importing">imported MP0</a>.
But you have to fork our repository first.
If it&#8217;s not obvious how to do that, try following
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">these instructions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="_your_goal">2.2. Your Goal</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We provide skeletons of three classic sorting algorithms for you to implement:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">bubble sort</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort">selection sort</a>,
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">merge sort</a>
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.
Implement one, two, or all three of these algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then use the provided plotting tool to explore their performance.
Remember from the written component that algorithm performance can be affected
by both the size <em>and</em> the structure of the inputs.
We&#8217;ve given you inputs both of different size and structure, so this should be
an ideal starting point for an exploration of their impact on the algorithms you
have completed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Work with other groups nearby to complete a characterization of all three
sorting algorithms.
You should be able to answers questions about how their performance varies with
input size, but also about how well they perform on different sized inputs.
You are free to split up the problem so that each group implements one sorting
algorithm and then you all compare results.</p>
