<p>The goal of this lab is to prepare you to begin work on the Android set of MPs
(MP6 and MP7) and your final project.
You&#8217;ll prepare your development environment by installing
<a href="/MP/setup/android-studio/">Android Studio</a>,
build and run a simple Android app using the Android emulator,
and familiarize yourself with the
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/">Microsoft
Computer Vision Application Programming Interface (API)</a>.</p>

Consult the screencast above for instructions on how to do this.
You can test whether your emulated camera is working by using the built-in
Android Camera app.
If possible, set up your emulated camera to use your computer&#8217;s built-in webcam,
assuming it has one.</p>

<h2 id="_introduction_to_apis_span_class_text_muted_45_minutes_span">2. Introduction to APIs <span class="text-muted">(45 Minutes)</span></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API stands for
<em>application programming interface</em></a>.
The better you become at understanding and using existing APIs, the faster and
more easily you will be able to build powerful apps and programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_an_api">2.1. What is an API?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the most general terms, an API is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components</a>.
For this lab and MP6 and MP7, we are particularly interested in the subset of
<em>remote web-based APIs</em>.
These APIs are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>remote</em>: they are accessed over the internet, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>web-based</em>: they are accessed using standard web protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way of thinking about APIs is that somewhere, in some data center full of
computers, is a computer that will run certain functions for you if ask it
nicely.
To use that functionality you don&#8217;t have to know where that computer is, or how
the function works.
You just have to learn how to get the data to the API in the format that it
expects, and understand how to interpret the results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An API like a collection of functions, with each function providing different
functionality.
Using an API is very much like calling a function&mdash;except that to use a
<em>remote</em> API we need to figure out how to get the data to the API and get the
results back.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_microsoft_cognitive_services">2.2. Microsoft Cognitive Services</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this lab and for MP6 we&#8217;re going to focus on using a portion of the
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Microsoft
Cognitive Services API</a>.
It provides a variety of features focused on enabling interaction with users in
intuitive ways&mdash;processing vision and speech data, and providing
intelligent search, recommendation, and natural language services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why should you use this API?
Well, imagine that you want to extract information from photos taken by users of
your new app.
You have two options:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spend several years mastering the sophisticated machine learning and computer
vision algorithms required to implement your own solution&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#8230;&#8203;or, use the Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision API.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By using APIs you are truly able to stand on the shoulders of giants.
Don&#8217;t waste your time solving problems that you aren&#8217;t interested in solving!
Chances are that somebody else is waiting for you to solve the problem that
<em>you</em> want to solve.
Get on to that and focus on changing the world, not re-solving problems that
others have already solved.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_using_the_cognitive_services_computer_vision_api">2.3. Using the Cognitive Services Computer Vision API</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get a sense of what the Cognitive Services Computer Vision API can do,
experiment with some of the examples
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/">on
this page</a>.
For each feature, upload your own images to get a sense of what kind of
capabilities this API has.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, MP6 will focus on the image analysis feature: the first one
listed on
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/">this
page</a>.
Go through the sample images and see if you can understand the results returned
by the API:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Are the results accurate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases where they are inaccurate, can you figure out why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of information is reported by the API?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What parts of it are you most surprised by and why?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_gaining_api_access">2.4. Gaining API Access</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like many remote APIs, gaining <em>programmatic</em> access to the Microsoft Cognitive
Services API in your app requires a <em>key</em>.
Keys allow API provides to control who uses their services, and allows providers
to begin to charge API users if their usage exceeds various thresholds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Happily, many remote APIs provide free access for usage that is more than
sufficient to develop and test your own programs.
And, as a student, you also have access to many free programs offered by
companies to introduce you to their APIs and services.
So you can try out a lot of things without paying a dime.
Of course, once your app built using the Microsoft Cognitive API takes off and
is being used by one million people, you&#8217;ll need to start shelling out some
money to Microsoft.
But let&#8217;s get there first.</p>
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center mt-3 mb-3">
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
      <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/u0eVbgBddsI" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the first step to gaining access to the Cognitive Services API is to get an
API key.
You can
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/">follow these instructions</a>
or watch the screencast above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Microsoft API keys are only valid for specific regions, so note that when you
generate your key.
You&#8217;ll need both the key <em>and</em> the region in just a minute.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_an_example_application">2.5. An Example Application</h3>
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>Finally, we&#8217;re going to use the API key that you obtained to start examining the
output of calls to the Microsoft Computer Vision API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note that we are using IntelliJ again, not Android Studio, since this is a
standalone Java application, not an Android app.</strong>
We&#8217;ve set up an
<a href="https://github.com/cs125-illinois/Lab9">Lab 9 GitHub repository</a>
containing an IntelliJ Project that&#8217;s correctly configured for Lab 9.
Getting access to it is similar to how you
<a href="/MP/setup/git/#importing">imported MP0</a>.
But you have to fork our repository first.
If it&#8217;s not obvious how to do that, try following
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">these instructions</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this as your starting point, try to get to the point where you can make
valid calls to the Microsoft Computer Vision API.
Once you have accomplished that, try to adjust the URL to investigate different
images.</p>
